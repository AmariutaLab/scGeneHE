# scGeneHE (single cell Gene expression Heritability Estimation)

scGeneHE is a method that aim to increase the power of cis-heritaiblity estimates by leveraging the intra- and inter- individual correlation using scRNA-seq data. 

## Environment Setup

Note: This pipeline is still under development. Please wait for our release of a reproducible Snakemake workflow. For now, to run the source code, separate environments of R and Python are required.



## Commands

scGeneHE includes three sequential steps to conduct cis-heritability estimation: generating GRM (genetic relationshipe matrix), point estimate, bootstrap estimate. Each step depends on the previous step's output. 



## Example Usage
